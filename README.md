# LaTeX Template for ESM Theses

This template was originally derived from **https://github.com/TUM-Dev/tum-thesis-latex** and later modified to fit the **ESM** style. Always check the [current formatting guidelines][thesis-guidelines] for the School of Computation, Information and Technology (CIT) before you hand your thesis in.

## üë∑ How to Build the PDF?

Use the command `make pdf && make clean` to build the PDF at `build/main.pdf`. We recommend using the "latex-workshop" extension for VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop.
