First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Moritz Makowski, and professor and supervisor, Prof. Dr. Jia Chen, for their guidance and encouragement.
Their support was incredibly valuable when the challenges at hand seemed almost impossible to overcome.
I am grateful for being entrusted with this novel and challenging idea and for the opportunity to independently research this project.
I do not take this opportunity for granted and am thankful for it.

I also extend my thanks to my friends.
I could not have wished for better ones in my life.
Whenever I faced uncertainties, my friends were my first point of contact.

Lastly, I offer my heartfelt appreciation to my family - my elder brother, my two sisters, and my parents - for their endless love, support, and understanding during tough times.
Although they could not provide much assistance on educational topics throughout my life, I know they would have helped if they could.
They always believed in me, even when I did not believe in myself.
Especially to my parents, I acknowledge how much you have sacrificed to make this education possible and will forever be grateful.
Without my family, this accomplishment would not have been possible.
