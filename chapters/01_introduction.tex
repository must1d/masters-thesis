\section{Motivation}
Bottom-up emission estimations are inaccurate.
Instead, top-down approaches could be used.
... et al. demonstrate that top-down approaches can be represented as an inverse problem with measurements $y$ and the emission field as $x$.
The transport of ghg molecules can be modeled as a linear map $A$ between $y$ and $x$, resulting in the following inverse problem:
\begin{equation}
	y = Ax
\end{equation}
In their paper, ... et al. show that using
