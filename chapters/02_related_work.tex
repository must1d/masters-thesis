\section{Compressed Sensing}
There are three main approaches to alleviate sparsity constraint.
1) transforms, such as Wavelet
2) only searching for unknown emissions and take esimtations as basis
3) Deep learning based approaches

\section{Deep Learning for Inverse Problems}
The field of medical imaging has made advancements in the inverse problems using deep learning.
A review of different deep learning approaches for CS is given in \parencite{ReviewCSUsingAI}
They mention Bora et al \parencite{CSUsingAI}.
Their approach has the limitation that the reconstruction is constrained to the range of the generator.
This, however, can improved by also taking into account other things: \parencite{SparseCSUsingAI}.
